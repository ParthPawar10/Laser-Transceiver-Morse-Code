Laser Transceiver Morse Code
This project integrates Morse code encoding and laser communication technology to facilitate high-speed, reliable data transmission over optical fibers. Using Arduino microcontrollers, this system transmits data through laser pulses, with the data being encoded in Morse code. The transmitted laser signal is received by another Arduino setup with a photoresistor, which decodes the Morse code and displays the message.

Project Overview
This system uses laser technology to encode text messages into Morse code and transmit them over a distance. The receiving side uses a photoresistor to decode the light pulses back into text. The simplicity of Morse code and the directional transmission of lasers provide a unique solution for reliable communication, especially in environments where traditional communication methods are not feasible.

Hardware Requirements
2 x Arduino microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino Uno)

1 x Laser Module (KY-009)

1 x Photoresistor (LDR)

1 x 1K ohm Resistor (for voltage divider)

Connecting wires

Breadboard

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE

Libraries for Arduino programming (Standard libraries for handling LEDs, serial communication, etc.)

System Design
The system consists of two modules:

Transmitter Module: Encodes text into Morse code and transmits it via a laser.

Receiver Module: Decodes the Morse code from the laser using a photoresistor and Arduino processing.

The transmitter module uses an Arduino to control a laser module. The Morse code is generated by toggling the laser on and off with timing corresponding to the dots and dashes of Morse code.

The receiver uses a photoresistor and an Arduino to receive and decode the signals, interpreting the duration of the light pulses as either a dot, dash, or gap.

Installation
Set up the hardware:

Connect the laser module to the transmitter Arduino and the photoresistor to the receiver Arduino.

Ensure proper wiring of the laser and sensor to their respective Arduino analog pins.

Upload the Code:

Download the Arduino code files (transmitter.ino and receiver.ino) from the repository.

Open the files in the Arduino IDE and upload them to the respective Arduinos.

Calibration:

Calibrate the system by ensuring the laser is correctly aligned with the photoresistor for optimal signal reception.

Test the system in a controlled environment with minimal ambient light.

Usage
Transmitting a message:

Use the transmitter module to input a message, which will be encoded into Morse code and transmitted via the laser beam.

Receiving and decoding a message:

The receiver module will decode the transmitted light signals and display the decoded message on the serial monitor.
