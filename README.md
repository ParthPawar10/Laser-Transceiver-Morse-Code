#  Laser Transceiver Morse Code System

A communication system using **Arduino**, **laser modules**, and **photoresistors** to send and decode Morse code messages via light signals. 
This project bridges old-school Morse code with modern embedded systems for wireless optical communication.

##  Overview

This project demonstrates how to transmit text using Morse code over a laser beam and decode it using an Arduino-based receiver. It's ideal for educational, hobbyist, and backup communication applications where low power and high security are priorities.

## Features

- Arduino-based transmitter and receiver
- Real-time encoding/decoding of Morse code
- Adaptive light thresholding for noise resistance
- Interrupt-driven data capture for higher accuracy
- Visual debugging via serial monitor

##  System Architecture

1. **Transmitter**:
   - Arduino with a laser module
   - Encodes characters into Morse code
   - Blinks laser on/off to send dot/dash signals

2. **Receiver**:
   - Arduino with a photoresistor (LDR)
   - Decodes laser blinks into Morse symbols
   - Reconstructs readable characters using a binary tree

##  Hardware Required

- 2√ó Arduino Uno/Nano
- 1√ó KY-008 Laser Module
- 1√ó LDR (Photoresistor)
- 1√ó 1KŒ© Resistor
- Breadboard, wires, USB cables

## Software Components

- **Encoder Sketch** (`encoder/encoder.ino`): Converts string to Morse and flashes laser
- **Decoder Sketch** (`decoder/decoder.ino`): Detects light signals and decodes Morse
- **Logic Processor**: Adjusts for ambient light changes dynamically
- **Interrupt Service Routine**: Captures signal transitions with millisecond precision
- **Morse Tree Decoder**: Translates signals into characters using a binary tree
